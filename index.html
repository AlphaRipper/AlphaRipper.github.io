        <h2 id="steps">How to make Allo Parantha</h2>
        <h4> Making potato stuffing</h4>
        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> First boil 4 medium-sized potatoes. You can boil or steam the potatoes in a pressure cooker, steamer or electric cooker. Add enough water in a 2-litre pressure cooker or pan just about covering the potatoes.
<p>
For cooking in a pressure cooker – On a medium flame cook the potatoes in the water for 3 to 4 whistles. When the pressure settles down on its own in the cooker, remove the lid. Drain the water and allow the potatoes to become warm.</p>
<p>
For cooking in a pan – Cover the pan and cook potatoes in water till fork tender. When cooking potatoes in a pan, it helps to peel them first and chop them in 2 inch cubes. Chopped potatoes cook faster than whole potatoes. Using a colander, drain all the water and let the potatoes become warm.</p>
<strong>Step 2:</strong>
Peel & chop the boiled warm potatoes. Then mash the potatoes with a potato masher. You can even grate and then mash the potatoes.
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong>. The potatoes should be mashed very well. There should not be any tiny bits of unmashed potatoes.Now add the chopped green chillies (1 to 2 green chilies, chopped finely), ¼ to ½ teaspoon punjabi garam masala powder or garam masala powder, ¼ to ½ teaspoon kashmiri red chilli powder or deghi mirch (optional), ½ to 1 teaspoon amchur (dry mango powder) and salt as per taste.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong>With a spoon, mix the spice powders and green chilies with the mashed potatoes very well. Check the taste and add more salt or red chilli powder or dry mango powder if required.

You can also add 1 to 2 tablespoons of finely chopped coriander leaves. Another variation is to add finely chopped onions if you like. But remember to chop the onions finely or else they pop out when rolling the parathas. Keep the prepared aloo stuffing aside.
</p>

<h2 id="suggestions">Some serving suggestions</h2>

<h2 id="expert">Expert Tips</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Cooking potatoes –</strong> Potatoes can be cooked either in a pan or in a pressure cooker. Potatoes can be steamed too. To cook potatoes in a pressure cooker or pan, add water just about covering the potatoes and cook them till they are softened well and fork-tender. For pressure cooking, cook for 3 whistles on a medium flame.</li>
<li><strong>Texture of mashed potatoes –</strong> The potatoes should be mashed very well. There should not be any lumps or small pieces in it so that the parathas do not break while rolling. The texture of mashed potatoes should be light and smooth.</li>
<li><strong>Mashed potatoes stuffing –</strong> To the potato stuffing you can add spices or herbs according to your taste and liking. In our homely heirloom recipe, we spice the potatoes with green chillies, red chilli powder, dry mango powder and garam masala.</li>

Apart from these spices, you can also add roasted cumin seeds powder (jeera powder), turmeric powder, black salt, dry pomegranate seeds powder (anardana powder) or coriander powder.
<li><strong>Making the paratha more nutritious –</strong> To the mashed potatoes stuffing, you can add a few more cooked and mashed veggies like peas, carrot, french beans. Some grated cheese or paneer can also be added to make these flat-breads making them more tasty & nutritious.</li>
<li><strong>Finely chopped herbs –</strong> Herbs like coriander leaves, green chillies have to be chopped finely. If you use onions, then chop them finely too.</li>
<li><strong>Tangy taste –</strong> The mashed potatoes stuffing have a slightly tangy taste in them. This tanginess is achieved by the addition of amchur powder which is basically finely ground sundried unripe mangoes. It is also called as dried mango powder. If you do not have dried mango powder, an easier substitute is lemon juice. Yet another substitute ingredient, but a rare one is dried pomegranate seeds powder (anardana powder).</li>
<li><strong>Oil or ghee –</strong> While kneading the dough either oil or ghee can be used. Adding either of them makes the parathas soft. To make the vegan aloo paratha, use oil to knead the dough and also to roast the parathas.</li>
<li><strong>Frying or roasting –</strong> Alu paratha can be either shallow fried or roasted. An iron griddle, which we call as tava in hindi is used to make paratha. The roadside stalls or dhaba shallow fry paratha in ghee or oil. At home they are roasted with some ghee or oil. Homemade paratha are healthier as compared to the fried paratha available outside.</li>
<li><strong>Hotness of the tawa (griddle) while roasting –</strong> Keep the flame medium-high to high while roasting parathas. If the heat is low, then the parathas become dense as they take a long time to cook. In case the heat increases in the tawa (due to the thickness or build of the tawa), then decrease the flame. You can always adjust the flame when cooking parathas.</li>
